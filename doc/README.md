## Documentation Overview

- `development_flutter.md` and the other `*_flutter.md` files are legacy planning notes for a discarded Flutter implementation. Keep them for historical reference only; do not follow them for the current Expo/React Native app.
- React Native specific guidance now lives in `AGENTS.md`. Extend that document or add new Expo-focused guides here as the architecture evolves.
